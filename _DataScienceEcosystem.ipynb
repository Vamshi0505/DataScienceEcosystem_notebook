These expressions are the foundation of all numerical computations.\n\nThe fundamental components of an arithmetic expression are:\nOperands: The values (numbers or variables) on which operations are performed. Examples: 5, 10.5, x, y.\nOperators: Symbols that perform specific mathematical operations on operands. Common arithmetic operators include:\n\n+ (Addition)\n- (Subtraction)\n* (Multiplication)\n/ (Division)\n** (Exponentiation)\n% (Modulus - returns the remainder of a division)\n// (Floor Division - returns the integer part of a division)\n\nExamples-\n\nThis is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.\n\neval_result = (3 * 4) + 5\nprint(eval_result)\nOutput: 17\n\nThis will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60\n200 / 60\n\nOutput: 3.3333333333333335",
